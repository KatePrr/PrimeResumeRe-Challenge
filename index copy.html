	  <p>Hi, I'm Kati Lueth, a Minnesota native who has been advenduring under the big skies of Montana for the past 6 years.</p>

	  <p>From Pastry School in Minneapolis, Spanish Immersion in Costa Rica to the Science of Nutrition in Montana, curiosity and exploration keep me going. When I'm not baking tasty pies and making sure the kitchen runs like butter (smooth, not melted), I enjoy river rafting, camping, biking and in winter working up a good frosty mustache by snow skiing.</p>
